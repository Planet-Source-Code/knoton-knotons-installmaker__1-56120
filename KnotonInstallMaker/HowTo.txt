Knotons Installmaker

It consist of three parts
KInstaller	(makes the setup packages)
KSetup	(Installs the setup packages)
KUninstall	(Uninstall what has been installed)

The main reason I have built this installmaker is because I was in need of an setup for easy distribution
of a major update at work. didnt feel like spend a lot of $ on a professional one.
I also built it because it was great fun and to see if I was able to :-)

As far as I can tell it works well for the purpose it was built.
It has great potential to be extended, feel free to do so and please share any extensions.


Credits
Goes to a lot of people, to many for me to remember.
I gained the knowledge howto build it from various places and programmers.
www.planet-source-code.com
www.allapi.net
and more.....
Thank you all, open source is the best source for knowledge :-)

How it works
First you must compile all three parts into the same directory.

You choose File/New in Kinstaller and gives your project the same name as the application you are
building a setup for. That name is later being used at various places, for example the descriptive name
in the add or remove programs applet...

You add Files by choosing Action/Add files

You change Destination by choose the destination in the Environ Path Variables combo, it then adds
to the textbox there you can add any trailing folders manually. after that check all files that should have
that destination and click Action/Change destination. Repeat until all files have the correct destination.

You add Links (shortcuts) by choosing the link in the Links combo and it then adds it to the textbox there
you manually could enter any trailing folders. After that check all files that should have that link and click
Action/Set link

Note that environ paths and links are casesensitive, DO NOT CHANGE IT.

You can mark files as shared by checking them and click Action/Mark files as shared.
This means your files wont be deleted during uninstall.

You can specify if the one installing must be admin by checking the checkbox User must be admin

You can specify if the one installing are allowed to choose his installationpath by checking the checkbox
Allow user to choose %InstallationPath%

You can also delete files, links, undo shared files..

Finally you are set to make the setup for your application
Click Action/Create cabinet
The cabinet will be made and Ksetup will be copied along with it with the name of your application
the cabinet and the renamed Ksetup file is the ones you distribute.


system directories for installation

%System32%		= Windows directory/System32
%InstallationPath%		= Program files\ name of your application, or userspecified if allowed
%CommonProgramFiles%	= Program files\Common Files
%ProgramFiles%		= Program files
%WinDir%		= Windows directory


Special folders directories for links/shortcuts

%Programs%		= Start\Programs (for current user)
%AllUsersPrograms%	= Start\Programs (for all users)
%AllUsersStartUp%		= Start\Programs\Startup (For all users)
%AllUsersDesktop%	= Desktop (For all users)
%Desktop%		= Desktop (For current user)
%SendTo%		= Shell\SendTo (For current user)
%StartUp%		= Start\Programs\Startup (for current user)
%QuickLaunch%		= Puts a quicklaunch link next to the startbutton

Note that you only can add trailing folders to Programs/AllusersPrograms.

Hope you will enjoy it.
